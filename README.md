# Mongo DB
This is a docker service that runs MongoDB. MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. We believe this is the most natural way to think about data, and is much more expressive and powerful than the traditional row/column model. 

# Configuration
This service will prepare the default users for the SPECIAL system and open the appropriate ports.
